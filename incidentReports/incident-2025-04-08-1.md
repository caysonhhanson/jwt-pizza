Incident: 2025-04-08 10-33-00
Summary
Between the hours of 10:33 and 12:33 on April 8, 2025, customers were unable to order pizzas due to validation failures with the pizza factory service. The event was triggered by chaos testing mode being active in the system. The incident was detected by our monitoring system which alerted on a 100% pizza order failure rate. The team resolved the issue by identifying an error resolution link in the application logs. This high-severity incident affected 100% of ordering attempts for approximately 2 hours.
Detection
This incident was detected when the Pizza Order Failure Rate alert was triggered at 10:33 AM, showing a 100% failure rate (7 failed orders). The response team was immediately notified and began investigation.
Our monitoring system correctly identified and alerted on the issue as soon as it occurred, demonstrating effective alert configuration.
Impact
For 2 hours between 10:33 UTC and 12:33 UTC on April 8, 2025, customers were completely unable to order pizzas from our service.
This incident affected 100% of customers attempting to place orders during this time frame, as all orders failed at the validation stage with the pizza factory.
The primary symptom was order submission failures, with orders appearing to be accepted but never completing processing.
Timeline
All times are UTC.

10:33 - Alert triggered for 100% pizza order failure rate
10:35 - Response team acknowledged the alert and began investigation
10:40 - Initial review of monitoring dashboards and logs commenced
10:45 - Manual testing confirmed the issue - all orders failing at the validation stage
11:15 - Determined the issue was related to pizza factory validation
12:15 - Error resolution link discovered in application logs
12:25 - Navigated to the error resolution link, which resolved the issue
12:33 - Service fully restored and verified via successful test orders

Response
After receiving the alert at 10:33 UTC, I immediately began investigating. The team first checked the monitoring dashboards to confirm the alert wasn't a false positive, then examined logs for error patterns.
After identifying consistent validation failures in the logs, the team discovered a specific error message containing a resolution link. When accessed, this link immediately restored normal service functionality.
Root cause
The root cause was the activation of chaos testing mode in the JWT Pizza application, which intentionally prevented pizza validation at the factory. The system was engineered to require operations staff to find and follow a resolution link embedded in error logs - simulating a real-world troubleshooting scenario.
Resolution
The issue was resolved by thoroughly analyzing application logs, identifying an error message containing a resolution link, and accessing that link to deactivate the chaos testing mode and restore normal operations.
This resolution method validated our observability setup, as the team was able to quickly access logs and identify the resolution path without modifying application code.
Prevention
This incident was part of planned chaos testing to validate our monitoring and incident response procedures. Our detection systems worked as expected by quickly alerting on the service disruption.
To improve future responses:

Document this specific chaos test pattern and resolution for faster remediation
Enhance our logging to make resolution pathways more prominent

Action items

Update runbook with details of this chaos test scenario and resolution method
Improve log analysis tooling to more quickly highlight resolution paths
Create additional alert rules for factory validation failures with potential resolution steps
Conduct team review of incident response to identify further improvement opportunities
